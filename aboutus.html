            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    With the rapid increase in urbanization, the 
                    production of waste is increasing. Mostly the collection of waste happens at the wrong time, which is the foremost reason for the overflowing of the dustbin. Overflowing of the bin causes the 
                    spread of a foul smell. The early waste collection would add-on 
                    to the higher running cost and higher traffic clogging. 
                    Therefore, there is a need to improve waste management
                    techniques. As the world is moving towards automatedand
                    smart techniques, there is a need to shift from traditional
                    methodsto smart waste management. It can be achieved by
                    using technology and data to improvise the handling and 
                    collection of waste. This paper describes the ideology of
                    automating the bin for opening and closing the lid and 
                    contributing to smart waste management by introducing IoT based control and monitoring of the dustbin. IoT platforms like 
                    Blynk IoT and Things peak are used to achieve the objective

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    India is the second most populated country in the world, waste management is of great challenge. India generates 62 
                    million tonnes of waste annually, which is estimated to be increased to 165 million tonnes by 2030.[1,2,3] Waste 
                    management is the biggest challenge to the authorities in developing countries, Waste leads to a great threat to the 
                    public health and environment if it is not stored and collected properly. The filling status of the bin is imperceptible by the authorities responsible to empty it felicitously, which causes the overflowing of the dustbin. Greenhouse gases like
                    methane, carbon monoxide, ammonia, and low level of radiation are released fromhousehold municipal waste. It not 
                    only contributes to the production of green gases effect but also causes the exploitation of the water bodies. Rainwater
                    easily mixes with toxic substances and drenches into nearby water bodies,[4,5] which may also ex- plot the groundwater. 
                    The stray animals residing in urban areas of developing countries ingest the plastic waste from open dustbins causing 
                    health hazards. Ruminal im- paction, indigestion, recurrent tympany, and many other health hazards are caused in the
                    ruminants due to the accumulation of plastic foreign into theirrumen.
                    The objective of an IoT-based smart dustbin is to provide access for continuous monitoring of the filling status of the bin 
                    to the concerned authorities responsible to empty it felicitously. Therefore, giving a wide berth to the spread of 
                    foul smells due to the overflowing of the dustbins. The following is achieved using an IoT platform, Thingspeak. 
                    Thing speak is an IoT analytics platform that allows us to visualize and analyse the live data streams in the cloud, 
                    without developing web software or setting up servers.To enhance the collection of waste promptly the concerned 
                    authorities are to be notified of the filling status of a dustbin, at least when it is about to fill. To achieve the following Blynk IoT application is used. Blynk provides an automated notification triggered by the user-defined condition. The 
                    notification could be sent as an in-application push notification, email, and SMS notification.[8] Hence these IoTbased platforms serve to attain continuous monitoring of the dustbins and notify the concerned authorities to empty the
                    dustbin in time.
                    Word To avoid the dissipation of foul odour from the garbage in a dustbin, it is automated to open and close the lid 
                    on detecting humans approaching the dustbin. This will isolate waste inside the dustbin and pitch in to overcome the 
                    ingestion of plastic into the stray animals. There are a few more auxiliary features, which will be described later in this 
                    paper. The following features collectively contribute to smart waste management
                    2007 The approach presented constitutes various hardware components that include sensors, actuators, and controllers. 
                    The controllers are programmed using Arduino Integrated
                    Development Environment (IDE) software to actuate the hardware accordingto the requirements specified by the user, 
                    which depends on input received from sensors. Arduino IDE connects to Arduino hardware allowing us to upload the 
                    program written in the text editor present in it.[9] The simulation of the circuit is done in tinker- cad, which will be 
                    discussed in detail further in this paper. Tinker cad is a web application that facilitates electronic circuit simulation and 3D designing.

            <h3>Hardware Setup</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    First, Arduino UNO is a microcontroller based on ATmega328P. It has 14 digital in-put/output (IO) pins, out of 
                    these 6 pins may provide a Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) output, 6 analog input pins, and a few peripheral devices that
                    make it handyto use.[11] NodeMCU is an open-source IoT platform. ESP8266-12E version of NodeMCU is used where E stands for Enhanced.

                    The ultrasonic sensor has a receiver and transmitter. A 
                    pulse for 10 μs is triggered from the IO port of Arduino as
                    an input to trigger pin of an ultrasonic sensor. The ultrasonic
                    sensor automatically sends eight 40KHz pulses and the
                    receiver detectswhether there is a pulse received back at the 
                    echo pin of the ultrasonic sensor.
                    The speed of the sound is 341 m/s in air.[14] Distance is 
                    calculated using the formula equation (1).
                    SG90 servo motor serves as an actuator that provides a 
                    displacement from 0° to 180°. Input to the servo motor is a 
                    PWM signal, Which can generate a torque of 1.7 Kg-cm.[15]
                    LCD 16x2 implies Liquid Crystal Display that has 16 columns 
                    and two rows, so it can display a total of 32 characters. IR 
                    sensor has a transmitter and a receiver that detects obstacles. 
                    The working of the IR sensor is similar to that of the ultrasonic
                    sensor, the emitter transmits infrared radiation into the
                    surroundings andthe receiver looks for that specific radiation 
                    to be received back. If the radiation is received it sends a high 
                    input to the microcontroller indicating the presence of an 
                    obstacle. A Piezo buzzer is an electronic device that is used to 
                    produce an alarm or tone. A potentiometer is a three-terminal 
                    variable resistor, which is used to control the contrast of the 
                    LCD used in the smart dustbin.

                    The schematic layout and circuit diagram is shown in Fig. 
                    1(a). and 1(b) mark out the connection of hardware 
                    components to the microcontroller. The digital IO pins of
                    Arduino UNO are connected to the trigger and echo pins of 
                    the ultrasonic sensor, buzzer, IR sensor, and respective pins of 
                    LCD. The digital IO pin 7 of Arduino UNO is connected to 
                    the servo motor since it can provide PWM signals to actuate it 
                    based on the requirement. IR sensor provides a digital input to 
                    Arduino through an IO pin that implicates obstacles 
                    specifically humans in the following case. The buzzer receives 
                    input from the controller and acts accordingly.

                    The setups integrated with hardware components are 
                    shown in Fig. 2. A Handmade Circuit Board(HCB) with a 
                    modular arrangement is designed considering the effective 
                    sonic sensor is placed inside the bin, which provides distance 
                    as an input to the microcontrollers. LCD is placed over the bin, 
                    providing visuals of the dustbin's filling status. Arduino UNO
                    and NodeMCU are connected using a serial communication
                    port. A piezo buzzer is connected to the circuit which 
                    generates a specific sound in a specified situation, which will 
                    be described later. The setup is powered using two AA-type
                    rechargeable batteries each of 3200mAh.

            <h3>Working</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The block architecture shown in Fig. 3. illustrates the 
                    working of all the hardware components collectively for the 
                    functioning of a smart dustbin. The input in terms of distance 
                    received from the ultrasonic sensor is processed by the 
                    Arduino UNO to obtain the filling status of the dustbin in 
                    terms of percentage and displayed over the LCD. When the IR 
                    sensor detects the human it sends a digital input to the 
                    Arduino. Arduino checks if the dustbin is full or has space
                    to accommodate waste, if it hasspace it sends the PWM input to the servo motor which opens the lid. If the dustbin is filled 
                    the servo locks at its position, and simultaneously the buzzer 
                    rings implicating that the dustbin is filled. It creates a mental 
                    dilemma for the person that may stop him from throwing the 
                    waste around the bin.

                    The filling status of the dustbin is continuously 
                    communicated to NodeMCU from Arduino through serial 
                    communication. NodeMCU Will push the respective data
                    thingspeak. When the filling percentage is more than 90%, a 
                    notification is sent to the concerned authorities to empty it, 
                    along with the location of the bin. The use of the buzzer will 
                    be limited since the dustbin would be emptied timely

                    4.1. Tinkercad Simulation
                    Before implementing hardware and code compilation in 
                    the Arduino IDE application, the code required to obtain 
                    output and circuit was first simulated in the tinker cad web
                    application. At the end of this phase, the possible errors and a 
                    list of required components were obtained

                    the Arduino IDE application. The code is opti- mized to 
                    minimize the power consumption by the hardware 
                    components. The circuit simulated is then implemented over 
                    an HCB as shown in Fig. 2. Placement of the sensors and 
                    other hardware equipment was planned in correspondence to 
                    the requirement. The data obtained from the sensors were 
                    further processed by the microcontroller and the output is
                    obtained.
